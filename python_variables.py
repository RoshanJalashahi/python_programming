# variable are the containers that contains a data values
# to create a varaible you just need to assign valiues to it
''' for example '''
x = 2
y = 'Roshan'
print(x)
print(y)


''' we can easily change the data  types of variables  for example '''
x = 4
x = 'prabina'
print(x)

''' varibles name are case sensitives i. e a and A are two different variables'''
a = 25
A = ' Prabina'
print(a)
print(A)


''' cjhanging variables data types i.e type casting'''

x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

''' we can also get the types of variables
using type() function'''
x = 5
y = 'Prabina'
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
