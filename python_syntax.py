# indentation is very important in python because python uses a indentation to indicate a block of code
if 5 > 2:
 print("5 is larger")

 # for the same block of code the space i.e indentation must be same
 #example
 #if 5 > 2:
     #print("5 is larger")
        #print("5 is larger again")
 # Here in the above example the error will occur
 #CORRECTLY SYNTAX WILL BE
 if 5 > 2:
  print("5 is larger")
  print("5 is larger")
